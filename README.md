# OpenCV Colour Calibration and Detection

Utilizes Python and OpenCV in order to find user-defined color ranges straight from your desktop. The inputs are RGB and outputs HSV in a format familiar to OpenCV (0 to 255). The OpenCV GUI allows any user to run the python script and have a visual aid, which makes finding colour ranges very simple.

## Prerequisites
